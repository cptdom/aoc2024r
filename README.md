## AOC2024 in Rust
- out of boredom
- to refresh my rusty basic Rust knowledge
- this is definitely not a bragging repo - I used chatGPT to improve my code (finding correct methods, never asking for correct logic) and sometimes I had to take a look at other solutions to understand how to tackle an issue
- WARNING: a lot of goofy notes across the codebase
