## AOC2024 in Rust
- to refresh my rusty basic Rust knowledge and my rusty brain
- this is definitely not a bragging repo - I used chatGPT to improve my code (finding correct methods, never asking for correct logic) and sometimes I had to take a look at other solutions to understand how to tackle an issue
- WARNING: a lot of goofy notes across the codebase
- code organized by tasks, that is, each day has 2 tasks -> e.g. day 14 task 2 is found under `tasks/28/...`
- currently done up to day 15 task 1 - lack of motivation going forward due to the nature of the tasks being quite repetitive
